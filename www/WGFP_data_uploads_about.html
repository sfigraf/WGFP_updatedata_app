<h3> How to Use </h3>

<p> Upload the most recent data files from the Biomark or Stationary Antennas in .txt (Stationary), .csv (Stationary file that has already been cleaned by the function) or .xlsx (Biomark) form using "Choose New Detection File". 
Upload the previous combined WGFP_Raw or Biomark_Raw csv using "Choose Previous Data File". 
These new detections and the old detections are combined and shown in the "Combined Data" tab. 
Save the New Detection File as its own CSV with "Save New Detections as CSV", and
click "Save Combined Data" to save a new master excel sheet. Add ".csv" to the filename and save.
Then, choose a new file to upload and re-upload the previously combined WGFP_Raw or Biomark_Raw file. Recombine and Re-save. Repeat as needed.

<b> Notes: </b>
</p>

<p>
Older .txt files from the beginning of the project won't currently work because they have different fields than the current fields being used. The current max upload setting is 600 mb. 
Files are quick to upload but .txt files are automatically cleaned to a viewable, 
usable form which often takes some time. A 10 mb file should take about 3 mins, depending on processing power. A 30 mb file took 27 minutes. If the new detections file is too large it may not display on the table.
